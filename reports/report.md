## Power Lines - background
Power lines are critical infrastructure, and it is important that they are in good condition. If they are not, 
it can lead to power outages, which can be very costly among other things. To prevent power outages, power lines 
are inspected regularly. Power lines are installed across the entire world, forming an extensive network that spans
vast distances. There are multiple layers of power grids, and in Norway the high-voltage distribution grid alone 
spans a total length of 100,000 kilometers.

### Current state of power lines inspection
Traditionally, power line inspection has been carried out by human inspectors who visually 
inspect power lines, towers, and associated equipment, either by foot or using specialized equipment 
such as helicopters or drones. These methods need lots of preparations and expensive equipment which could have been 
done in a better way if there were better methods for inspections.  


### Challenges in power lines inspection
There are several challenges in power lines inspection. The most dangerous is the risk of electrocution and 
working in heights. Under inspection, it is important that the power lines are secured and grounded in addition 
to that the person is secured from falling down. If the inspection is done with helicopters there are risk of 
collision with the power lines which could be fatal. This risk could in worst case lead to death. 
Considering the large geographical areas that power lines cover, an inspection is challenging 
due to terrain and landscape, time-consuming and expensive.



### The future of power lines inspection?
The future of power lines inspection will be more efficient and cheaper. The process could be more automated 
by using deep learning which could be trained to automatically analyze large amounts of data from power lines.
This would reduce the need for manual inspection which would reduce the risks the inspectors are exposed to. 
This would also be more efficient and more robust since the inspectors does not have to handle challenging terrain
and deep learning algorithms can learn complex patterns that could be used
